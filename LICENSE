## Disclaimer

### Trading Risk Warning

CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS AND IS NOT SUITABLE 
FOR ALL INVESTORS. THE VALUATION OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND FUTURES MAY FLUCTUATE, 
AND, AS A RESULT, CLIENTS MAY LOSE MORE THAN THEIR ORIGINAL INVESTMENT.

THE IMPACT OF SEASONAL AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS IS ALREADY FACTORED INTO MARKET 
PRICES. THE HIGHLY LEVERAGED NATURE OF FUTURES TRADING MEANS THAT SMALL MARKET 
MOVEMENTS WILL HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON YOUR TRADING ACCOUNT AND THIS CAN WORK 
AGAINST YOU, LEADING TO LARGE LOSSES OR CAN WORK FOR YOU, LEADING TO LARGE GAINS.

THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT YOU COULD SUSTAIN A LOSS OF SOME OR ALL OF YOUR 
INITIAL INVESTMENT AND THEREFORE YOU SHOULD NOT INVEST MONEY THAT YOU CANNOT 
AFFORD TO LOSE. YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF ALL THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH 
CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING AND SEEK ADVICE FROM AN INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISOR 
IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS.
